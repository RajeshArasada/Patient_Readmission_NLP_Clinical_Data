# Patient_Readmission_NLP_Clinical_Data

Predicting Hospital Readmission with Discharge Summaries
Model definition:¶
Predict which patients are at risk for 30-day unplanned readmission utilizing free-text hospital discharge summaries.

Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III(MIMIC-III) is a free hospital database. It harbors de-identified information from over 40,000 patients who were admitted to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts from 2001 to 2012.

For this project we will use two tables from this database:

ADMISSIONS - a table containing patients information including the admission and discharge dates for each admission

NOTEEVENTS - a table containing all notes for each hospitalization Both these tables share Hospital admission IDs (HADM_ID)

Due to the restricted access, the github version of this code will show minimal individual patient data.
